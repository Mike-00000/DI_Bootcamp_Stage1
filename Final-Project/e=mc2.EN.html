                E=mc² (pronounced "E equals M C squared") is a famous equation in 
                physics that was first introduced by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper 
                "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies." This equation is one of the 
                most well-known and important equations in all of physics, and it 
                describes the relationship between energy (E), mass (m), and the speed 
                of light (c).
                <br>The equation itself states that the energy (E) of an object is equal to 
                its mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared. This means that 
                even a small amount of mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of 
                energy, as long as the speed of light is involved.
                The implications of this equation are profound and have been explored in 
                many areas of physics, including nuclear energy and particle physics. 
                In nuclear reactions, for example, a small amount of mass is converted into 
                a large amount of energy, as described by E=mc².
                <br>Einstein's famous equation has also had a significant impact on the field of 
                cosmology, as it helps to explain the nature of the universe and its origins. 
                The equation suggests that the total energy of the universe is equivalent to its 
                total mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.
                <br>In summary, E=mc² is a groundbreaking equation in physics that describes 
                the relationship between energy, mass, and the speed of light. 
                Its implications have been explored in many areas of physics and have helped 
                to shape our understanding of the universe.
