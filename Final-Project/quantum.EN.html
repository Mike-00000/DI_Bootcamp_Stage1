                Albert Einstein made several important contributions to quantum physics 
                throughout his scientific career. <br>Here are some of his most significant contributions:
                <br>1.	Photoelectric effect: In 1905, Einstein proposed a theoretical explanation for 
                the photoelectric effect, which is the phenomenon by which electrons are ejected from a 
                metallic surface when it is exposed to light of certain wavelengths. His theory suggested 
                that light is composed of particles (called photons) having an energy proportional to 
                their frequency, rather than a continuous wave as previously thought.
                <br>2.	Theory of special relativity: In 1905, Einstein also published his theory of 
                special relativity, which completely revolutionized our understanding of the nature of 
                space and time. The theory posits that the speed of light is constant and that the laws 
                of physics must be the same for all inertial observers. This theory led to the equivalence 
                between matter and energy, the famous formula E=mcÂ².
                <br>3.	Compton effect: In 1923, Arthur Compton observed that photons interacting with 
                electrons have a longer wavelength after the collision than before. Einstein developed 
                a theory that explained this effect using both the theory of photons and special relativity.
                <br>4.	Einstein's uncertainty principle: In 1927, Einstein proposed an objection to quantum 
                mechanics, which argued that the state of a subatomic particle was not determined until it was 
                measured. In collaboration with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, he developed an argument 
                (the famous EPR paradox) showing that the theory of quantum mechanics was incomplete.
                <br>These contributions have had a significant impact on quantum physics and have contributed 
                to our understanding of the nature of the universe at a subatomic scale. Einstein also inspired 
                many other scientists to work on problems related to quantum physics, paving the way for new 
                developments in this field.
