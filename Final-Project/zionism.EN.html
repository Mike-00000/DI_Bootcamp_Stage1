                Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew 
                University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first 
                Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and 
                president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help 
                raise funds for the planned university. He made suggestions for the 
                creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an 
                Institute of Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics 
                such as malaria, which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third 
                of the country's development. He also promoted the establishment of an 
                Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both 
                Hebrew and Arabic.
                <br>Einstein was not a nationalist and was against the creation of an 
                independent Jewish state, which would be established without his help 
                as Israel in 1948. He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah 
                could live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine. Nevertheless, upon the 
                death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister David 
                Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of President of 
                Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach. The offer was presented by Israel's 
                ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer "embodies 
                the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons". 
                Einstein wrote that he was "deeply moved", but "at once saddened and ashamed" 
                that he could not accept it.
