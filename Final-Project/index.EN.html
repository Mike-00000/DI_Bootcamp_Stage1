                    <h2>Special Relativity</h2>

                    <div class="special_relativity">The theory of special relativity is a physical theory developed by 
                        Albert Einstein in 1905 to explain phenomena observed in moving systems. The theory posits that 
                        the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to a given 
                        reference frame, regardless of the speed of those observers.
                        The theory of special relativity is based on two fundamental postulates:
                        The constancy of the speed of light: the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same, regardless 
                        of the velocity of the observer.
                        The principle of relativity: all physical laws have the same form for all observers in uniform 
                        motion relative to each other.
                        These postulates have important implications for how we understand time, space, and motion.
                        One of the most well-known effects of special relativity is time dilation. According to the theory, 
                        clocks in motion run slower than clocks at rest. Thus, two clocks that are initially synchronized will 
                        no longer be synchronized if one of them is put into motion. This phenomenon is called time dilation.
                        Special relativity also implies a contraction of length in the direction of motion. This contraction 
                        is called the Lorentz contraction and it is proportional to the velocity of the object relative 
                        to the observer.
                        Finally, special relativity also implies the equivalence between mass and energy. This equivalence 
                        is expressed by the famous formula E = mc², where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of 
                        light in a vacuum.
                        These concepts have important implications for many areas of physics, such as electromagnetism, 
                        quantum mechanics, and cosmology. Special relativity is therefore a fundamental theory for our 
                        understanding of the universe.

                    <div class="general_relativity">General relativity is a physical theory that describes gravity as a 
                        curvature of spacetime. It was developed by Albert Einstein in 1915 and represents an evolution 
                        of his theory of special relativity.
                        The theory of general relativity states that the presence of mass and energy deforms the spacetime 
                        around it, creating a curvature that affects the motion of objects that move in that region of space. 
                        Gravity, according to this theory, is therefore the consequence of this deformation of spacetime.
                        General relativity also implies the existence of gravitational waves, which are perturbations of spacetime 
                        caused by massive objects in motion. These waves were observed directly for the first time in 2015.
                        The Einstein field equation is the key equation of general relativity. It describes the relationship 
                        between the geometry of spacetime and the distribution of mass and energy within that region. This equation 
                        is complex and difficult to solve, even for simple systems, but it has important implications for cosmology 
                        and the physics of black holes.
                        General relativity has been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations. It has provided a solid 
                        foundation for the study of physics at large scales, such as the study of the structure and evolution of 
                        the universe as a whole. It has also led to new discoveries, such as the existence of singularities and 
                        black holes, as well as interesting implications for quantum physics and the theory of quantum gravity.

                        &#x2794 Albert Einstein was a German theoretical physicist born on March 14, 1879 in Ulm, Germany. 
                        <br>&#x2794 He is best known for his theory of relativity, both the special and general, as well as his famous equation 
                        E=mc², which describes the relationship between mass and energy.
                        <br>&#x2794 Einstein began studying physics at the age of 16 and obtained his PhD in 1905 from the University of Zurich. 
                        It was that same year that he published three groundbreaking papers that laid the foundation for modern physics.
                        <br>&#x2794 In 1933, Einstein left Germany due to the rise of the Nazis and eventually emigrated to the United States, 
                        where he taught at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He remained there until 
                        is death in 1955.
                        <br>&#x2794 Einstein received numerous awards for his contributions to physics, including the Nobel Prize in Physics 
                        in 1921. 
                        <br>&#x2794 He is considered one of the greatest scientists of all time and his theory of relativity had a
