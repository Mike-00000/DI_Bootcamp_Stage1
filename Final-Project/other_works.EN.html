                1.	Unified field theory: In the later years of his life, 
                Einstein worked on the unified field theory, which seeks to 
                combine the fundamental forces of nature into a single, 
                coherent theory. He was particularly interested in unifying the 
                electromagnetic and gravitational forces. He proposed several 
                different approaches to achieve this, but none were completely 
                conclusive. Nevertheless, his research has inspired many other 
                scientists to pursue the quest for a unified theory.
                <br>2.	Theory of rotational relativity: In the theory of relativity, 
                Einstein had already shown that space-time is affected by the speed 
                of an observer's motion. In the 1910s, he continued this line of thought 
                by questioning whether the rotation of an object also influences its space-time. 
                His theory of rotational relativity, also called Mach's principle, 
                states that the rotation of an object is related to the space-time around it, 
                and that space-time is related to the distribution of matter in the universe.
                <br>3.	The Doppler-Fizeau effect: Einstein also studied the effects of the 
                relative velocity between the source and observer on the measurement of the 
                speed of light. The Doppler effect is a phenomenon that occurs when the apparent 
                frequency of a wave is changed due to the relative motion between the wave's source 
                and the observer. Einstein worked on a variant of this effect, called the 
                Doppler-Fizeau effect, which concerns the measurement of the speed of light 
                in moving media. This effect is used in practical applications such as measuring 
                wind speed in the atmosphere.
